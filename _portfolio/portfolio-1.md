During Mayâ€“July 2023, I participated in a research internship in Guangzhou, China, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_cL5pQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Changsong Liu</a>. This was my first exposure to natural language processing (NLP), Transformer-based models, and conversational AI systems.

I primarily worked on designing a psychological counseling robot using the RASA framework. My contributions included:

- Exploring the basics of Transformer-based NLP models and chatbot dialogue pipelines.
- Expanding and customizing datasets to support intent recognition and multi-turn conversation.
- Implementing dialogue flows using RASA stories and domain configuration.
- Conducting small-scale testing to evaluate response consistency.

This experience laid the foundation for my later work in AI and embedded systems, and cultivated my interest in human-centered intelligent systems.
