## ðŸ§  Psychological Counseling Robot Research (May â€“ July 2023)

**Institution:** Guangzhou, China  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Changsong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_cL5pQAAAAJ&hl=en)

First exposure to NLP and dialogue systems using **Transformer** and **RASA** frameworks. Key contributions include:

- Built intent-based dialogue logic using RASA pipelines
- Customized and expanded datasets for multi-turn conversation flows
- Implemented stateful response tracking via domain configuration
- Integrated fallback and confidence thresholds for robustness

This experience ignited my passion for human-centered AI systems and laid the foundation for further research.

## ðŸ§© Neuromorphic Intelligence & Mixed-Signal Circuits (July â€“ August 2023)

**Institution:** ShangHai, China  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Dr. Giacomo Indiveri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kdHjCAMAAAAJ&hl=en)

Worked on **neuromorphic hardware** and brain-inspired analog circuits to emulate neural dynamics. Under Prof. Indiveri's guidance, I:

- Studied synaptic dynamics and spiking neural circuits
- Explored mixed-signal design for on-chip learning systems
- Delivered a final talk on circuit-level implementations of STDP ([ðŸ“„ View slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m01NmtEKXjhTXBAF5e5LMCE1lE5W8tPg/view?usp=sharing))
- Co-authored my first conference paper with Prof. Indiveri

## ðŸŒ™ Low-Light Image Reconstruction with Non-Autoregressive Transformers (2024 â€“ 2025)

**Institution:** McMaster University  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Jun Chen](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/faculty/dr-jun-chen/)

In this project under the ELECENG 4OJ4 research course, I explored **low-light image enhancement** using **Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs)** integrated into a generative latent framework.

- Proposed a dual-stage mask-aware integration of NAT into image decoders
- Evaluated performance on LOL and GLARE datasets using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS
- Developed a reconstruction pipeline in PyTorch and visualized latent space transitions
- Authored a conference paper accepted by **IEEE ISIE 2025**
