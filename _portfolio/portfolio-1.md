This was my first exploration into natural language processing, conducted during a research internship in Guangzhou, China (Mayâ€“July 2023) under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_cL5pQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Changsong Liu</a>. 

I worked with RASA to build and extend datasets for a psychological counseling chatbot, enabling scenario-based dialogue flow. During this time, I familiarized myself with Transformer-based models and explored data augmentation methods for dialogue systems.

It was a two-month experience that sparked my interest in AI-human interaction and gave me hands-on experience in real-world NLP pipelines.
