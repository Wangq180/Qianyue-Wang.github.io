## 🧠 Psychological Counseling Robot Research (May – July 2023)

**Institution:** South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Changsong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_cL5pQAAAAJ&hl=en)

First exposure to NLP and dialogue systems using **Transformer** and **RASA** frameworks. Key contributions include:

- Built intent-based dialogue logic using RASA pipelines
- Customized and expanded datasets for multi-turn conversation flows
- Implemented stateful response tracking via domain configuration
- Integrated fallback and confidence thresholds for robustness

This experience ignited my passion for human-centered AI systems and laid the foundation for further research.

## 🧩 Neuromorphic Intelligence & Mixed-Signal Circuits (Summer 2024)

**Institution:** University of Zurich, Institute of Neuroinformatics  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Dr. Giacomo Indiveri](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/institute/people/faculty/giacomo.html)

Worked on **neuromorphic hardware** and brain-inspired analog circuits to emulate neural dynamics. Under Prof. Indiveri's guidance, I:

- Studied synaptic dynamics and spiking neural circuits
- Explored mixed-signal design for on-chip learning systems
- Delivered a final talk on circuit-level implementations of STDP ([📄 see slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m01NmtEKXjhTXBAF5e5LMCE1lE5W8tPg/view?usp=sharing))
- Co-authored my first conference paper with Prof. Indiveri

## 🌙 Low-Light Image Reconstruction with Non-Autoregressive Transformers (2024 – 2025)

**Institution:** McMaster University  
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Jun Chen](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/faculty/dr-jun-chen/)

In this project under the ELECENG 4OJ4 research course, I explored **low-light image enhancement** using **Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs)** integrated into a generative latent framework.

- Proposed a dual-stage mask-aware integration of NAT into image decoders
- Evaluated performance on LOL and GLARE datasets using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS
- Developed a reconstruction pipeline in PyTorch and visualized latent space transitions
- Authored a conference paper accepted by **IEEE ISIE 2025**

如果你喜欢，我可以帮你：

- 换成两栏排布（左图右文）
- 加插图
- 用 `<details>` 实现点击展开全文
- 用嵌入式 iframe 加载 PDF（只显示一个滑动框）

告诉我你喜欢哪种风格，我可以继续帮你生成完整的 HTML 或 Markdown！
