title: "Low-Light Image Reconstruction with Non-Autoregressive Transformers"
excerpt: "Research project on deep image enhancement using NATs, published at IEEE ISIE 2025.<br/><img src='/images/lowlight_nat.png'>". As part of the ELECENG 4OJ4 research course at <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/faculty/dr-jun-chen/" target="_blank">McMaster University</a>, I conducted a research project under the guidance of <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/faculty/dr-jun-chen/" target="_blank">Prof. Jun Chen</a>. My work focused on enhancing **low-light image reconstruction** by integrating Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) into a latent-space learning framework. Key outcomes include:
- Designing a mask-aware transformer structure for iterative image restoration.
- Integrating NAT modules into both latent encoder and decoder stages.
- Evaluating performance using PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and visual comparisons.
- Writing the final report: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UeG4kdlfmiiWvWWcqd7SZ2JBdkSBZ7nt/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>
- Publishing the results at IEEE ISIE 2025 with the paper: <em>“Enhancing Low-Light Image Reconstruction via Non-Autoregressive Transformers: A Mask-Aware Latent Integration Framework”</em>. This research bridges my interest in computer vision and model acceleration for edge inference.
