This talk presents my paper **‚ÄúEnhancing Low-Light Image Reconstruction via Non-Autoregressive Transformers: A Mask-Aware Latent Integration Framework‚Äù**, accepted at **ISIE25-000258**.
We propose a novel integration of non-autoregressive transformers into a latent feature reconstruction pipeline, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-light image datasets such as LOL and GLARE.
