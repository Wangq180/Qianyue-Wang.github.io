**🎤 Presentation video available:**
This talk presents my paper **“Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) Strategy for FPGA-Based Edge AI Inference”**, accepted at **ISIE25-000257**.
I propose a workload-aware DVFS solution tailored for FPGA-based edge AI systems. The method dynamically adjusts voltage and frequency based on task demands, reducing power consumption while maintaining low latency in AI inference tasks.
