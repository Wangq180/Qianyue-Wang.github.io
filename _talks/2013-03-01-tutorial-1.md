üé§ **Presentation video available**

This talk presents my paper **‚ÄúDynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) Strategy for FPGA-Based Edge AI Inference‚Äù**, accepted at **ISIE25-000257**.

We propose a workload-aware DVFS solution tailored for FPGA-based edge AI systems. The method dynamically adjusts voltage and frequency based on task demands, reducing power consumption while maintaining low latency in AI inference tasks.
