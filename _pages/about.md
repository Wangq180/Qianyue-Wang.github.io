## Biography

**Qianyue Wang** is an undergraduate student in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mechatronics/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), Canada. Her early research focuses on **computer vision**, **image processing**, and **image reconstruction**, where she has published multiple papers on visual restoration, deep learning-based PCB analysis, and benchmark dataset construction.  

More recently, her research interests have expanded toward the intersection of **hardware-efficient AI systems**, with a strong focus on **FPGA-based edge acceleration**, **low-power embedded computing**, and **real-time medical AI inference**. She is currently working on projects involving **dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)** on FPGAs and the design of **domain-specific accelerators** for medical image segmentation.  

Qianyue aims to bridge **deep learning algorithms** with **hardware-aware system design**, enabling efficient and deployable solutions for **AI-driven diagnostics** in resource-constrained embedded environments.

For a complete list of her publications and ongoing projects, please visit the [Publications](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/publications/) and [Research](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/portfolio/) pages.
