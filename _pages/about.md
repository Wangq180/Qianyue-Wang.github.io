## Biography

<p>Hi! I'm <span style="color:#007acc">Qianyue Wang</span>, an undergraduate student majoring in 
<a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mechatronics/" target="_blank">Mechatronics Engineering</a> at 
<a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank">McMaster University</a>, Canada.</p>

<p>My research journey began in the domain of 
<span style="color:#007acc">computer vision and image processing</span>, where I explored deep learning techniques for 
image reconstruction, low-light image enhancement, and PCB image understanding. I have developed and evaluated 
generative models, and contributed to benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics in this field.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I have also expanded my interests into 
<span style="color:#007acc">hardware-aware AI</span>, where I design 
<span style="color:#007acc">low-power embedded systems</span> and implement 
<span style="color:#007acc">FPGA-based accelerators</span> for medical AI applications. My work includes optimizing inference 
latency and energy efficiency through techniques such as DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling), and building 
simulation-based workflows for edge deployment without requiring physical FPGA boards.</p>

<p>I am passionate about bridging 
<span style="color:#007acc">machine learning algorithms</span> with 
<span style="color:#007acc">hardware architecture design</span>, aiming to create intelligent systems that are not only accurate, 
but also resource-efficient and deployable in real-world environments such as hospitals, factories, and remote health monitoring platforms.</p>

<p>I enjoy working at the intersection of algorithms and hardware, and I am always excited to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects. 
You can learn more about my work on the
