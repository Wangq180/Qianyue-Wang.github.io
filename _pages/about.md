## Biography

**Qianyue Wang** is an undergraduate student in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mechatronics/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), Canada. Her research interests lie at the intersection of **hardware-efficient AI systems**, **FPGA-based Edge AI acceleration**, and **low-power embedded computing** for real-time medical applications.  

She has published several papers in the fields of **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **FPGA-based system design**, with a growing focus on **medical AI inference optimization** and **energy-aware embedded controllers**. Qianyue is currently working on projects involving **dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)** strategies for FPGAs and the design of **domain-specific accelerators** for medical image processing.

She is also interested in bridging **machine learning algorithms** with **hardware-oriented architectures**, aiming to deliver **efficient and deployable solutions** for AI-driven diagnostics in embedded environments.
