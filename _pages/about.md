## Biography

Hi! I'm <span style="color:#007acc">Qianyue Wang</span>, an undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mechatronics/" target="_blank">Mechatronics Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank">McMaster University</a>, Canada.

My research started in the field of <span style="color:#007acc">computer vision and image processing</span>, focusing on topics like image reconstruction, low-light enhancement, and PCB image understanding. More recently, I’ve been diving into <span style="color:#007acc">hardware-efficient AI</span>, particularly building <span style="color:#007acc">low-power embedded systems</span> and designing <span style="color:#007acc">FPGA-based accelerators</span> for real-time medical AI applications.

I enjoy bridging the gap between <span style="color:#007acc">machine learning</span> and <span style="color:#007acc">hardware design</span> to create systems that are not only accurate but also efficient and deployable in edge environments.

You can check out my work on the [📄 Publications](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/publications/) and [🧪 Research Projects](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/portfolio/) pages.
