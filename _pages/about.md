## Biography

Hi! I'm **Qianyue Wang**, an undergraduate student in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mechatronics/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/), Canada.  

My academic journey began in the field of **computer vision**, where I worked on problems like image reconstruction, low-light image enhancement, and PCB image understanding using generative models such as MAE and VQGAN. I have authored several papers in this area, including one accepted at *IEEE ISIE 2025*.  

More recently, my research interests have expanded into **hardware-aware AI**. I’m exploring **FPGA-based Edge AI acceleration**, **low-power embedded systems**, and **medical AI inference optimization**, particularly using **DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling)** and resource-aware control strategies.  

My goal is to bridge the gap between AI algorithms and real-world hardware deployment — delivering efficient, scalable solutions for embedded and medical applications.  

📚 For a complete list of my work, please check out the [Publications](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/publications/) and [Research](https://wangq180.github.io/Qianyue-Wang.github.io/portfolio/) pages.
